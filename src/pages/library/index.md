One of Gatsby's powerful capabilities comes from plugins, though finding and creating plugins hasn't always been easy. After interviewing Gatsby users a few years ago, I drew an “empathy map” to put myself in their shoes.

## Learning from other plugin libraries
Instead of reinventing the wheel, I analyzed over 10 admirable and/or popular plugin libraries to draw from their strengths and learn from their weaknesses. Examples include:

* [JS.coach](https://js.coach/)
* [VIM Awesome](https://vimawesome.com/)
* [Best of JS](https://bestof.js.org/)
* [Sketch extension library](https://sketchapp.com/extensions/)
* [Chrome plugin library](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/plugins/mmcblfncjaclajmegihojiekebofjcen?hl=en)
* [Microsoft Visual Studio Code Extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/VSCode)
* [Wordpress Plugins](https://wordpress.org/plugins/)
* [Npms.io](https://npms.io/)
* [Yarnpkg.com](https://yarnpkg.com/en/packages)
* [Apple App store](https://www.apple.com/ios/app-store/)
* [Google Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/top)

## Prototypes and their evolutions
Here’s a GIF depicting prototypes I designed. I sought feedback from many community members and incorporated their feedback.

## End result
Since the launch of [the Plugin Library](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins) and plugin authoring docs in March 2018, the library has grown from 51 plugins to 2,264 plugins as of November 2020. The most used plugin is downloaded 1.7 million times per month.
