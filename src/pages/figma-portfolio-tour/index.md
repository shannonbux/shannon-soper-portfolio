Sit back and keep your arms and legs inside the car for a roller-coaster ride through my first years as a product designer at Gatsby. I was the first employee and first designer at the startup in 2018 and had so much fun doing these design projects! First you'll see a brief history about me and the company, then a high-level overview of the major projects I accomplished, and finally a deeper dive into an onboarding experience I redesigned.

P.S. To leave comments on the slides, scroll down this page to see more detailed instructions.
