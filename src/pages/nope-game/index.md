## Background

For 6 months I was the Product Designer for this solo project.

## The Dilemma

It's hard for many people, including me, to evaluate people's requests on my time and abilities. If say yes now, will I regret it later?

To train my ability to say no (or yes) with confidence, I use something called The Dime Game to evaluate requests. Through using it at least one hundred times and recommending it to friends and family and sharing it at work, I discovered some ways to make The Dime Game easier to use.

## Why I care

This project has been enormously fulfilling because I deeply care about clear communication. I've seen that this game can act like a friend who helps you not only decide whether to say yes or no to a particular request, but also helps you understand _why_ you answered the way you did. It imbues me with confidence in myself when I'm prepared to justify exactly why I'm saying yes or no.

## Lowering the barrier to entry

I often avoided using the worksheet because I didn't want to print a new one every time I needed to use it. Printing it was a minor tedium that created enough difficulty to justify avoiding the task.

I'd even look at the worksheet and, without writing on it, try to memorize my answers. Just to avoid reprinting it.

So, for a while I'd print stacks of worksheets to delay time between printing jobs. Finally, I made the worksheet reusable by laminating it and using erasable markers on the laminated version.

## Signifying the fork in the road

The left and right side of the worksheet, though they don't look like it, present a fork in the road of decision making. The left side of the worksheet is useful if you want to decide how strongly to _ask_ for something. The right side of the worksheet is useful when you need to decide how strongly to _say_ no to a request.

Even though most folks just want to use one side of the worksheet, at first glance it looks like you're supposed to fill out both sides. The confusion arises because both sides of the worksheet have the same level of hierarchy.

The question that actually deserves the highest level of visual priority is “are you asking for something or responding to a request?”

I decided to highlight this central question by creating entirely different experiences for each path in the fork.

## Paving the path

The first path I focused on is _decide how strongly to say no_ to a request, and the name "The Dime Game" doesn't welcome users to that path and clearly show them what it's about. After some brainstorming, I renamed it "The Nope Game." Even though it's possible to say yes to a request, I wanted a memorable name. Another option was "The Hell No Game", but the icon and URL didn't look compact or easy to read. "Nope" is a single word that succinctly communicates the heart of the game.

## Evoking a Magic 8 Ball

In my brainstorm, saying yes, no, and maybe conjured memories of Magic 8 Balls and watching the triangle floating to the top. The answer appeared as white text with blue liquid around it.

Abstracting the Magic 8 Ball image led me to a rounded equilateral triangle shape, the purplish blue color, a font that recalls 80's game shows. Here's a first draft of the abstract combination logo.

The layered triangles are intended to mimic motion, like shaking the Magic 8 Ball or playing a card game and splaying the cards out in your hands.

This is the first logo I've designed, and it was fun to experiment.

## Changing the genre

At the heart of The Nope Game are a series of yes or no questions. If you look at an example of the worksheet after someone has used it, they scribble “yes” or “no” or checks and x's in the margin because the worksheet doesn't have an official place to write answers and hoists work upon the user that isn't necessary.

In addition, there's some tricky math involved in adding up the responses. To save the user from doing the math, and to reduce the amount of work it takes for them to track their answers to each question, I put the game into a survey format on a website.

### Emphasizing prerequisites

One of the last questions on the worksheet is a sticking point for many people and blocks them from finishing the game. “Do I know what I am saying no to? (Is the other person clear about what is being asked for?)”

I could have just bumped this question up to the top of the survey. However, a text form had two advantages.

## Validating the answer

First, if the user is able to write down the other person's request, the request must be clear enough. Writing it down is therefore more powerful than simply ticking a box that says “yes”.

## Creating a visual reminder

Second, a text box remedied a shortcoming of the online survey. On the worksheet, most people scribbled a reminder of which scenario they were evaluating, e.g. "my neighbor wants to keep their food in my fridge." This allowed them to re-read their scenario if they wanted to revisit their decision or stop the game to go get a snack and return to it later.

The online survey initially lost this visual reminder. A worksheet has permanency and can keep visual reminders better than a survey; this is why many people still write passwords on sticky notes, to the chagrin of security-minded folks everywhere.

The text box gives users the ability to recreate that visual reminder. After they write it, the scenario sticks to the top of the screen so users can refer back to it at any point.

## Dealing with deal breakers

One survey question is a deal breaker. If you answer “no” to “Can I give this person what is wanted?”, there is no need to take the rest of the survey because, without further effort, you tell the person “no, I can't do that.” The survey needs to give users the ability to take this shortcut and an explanation of why the shortcut exists.

## Evolving the game

The pure visual design of the survey is abismal; I haven't spent any time on font, alignment, color, etc. So that's one next step.

Another structural change will be to let users save notes under each survey question so they can remember their reasoning, and to make the details viewable and editable at a later time if they want to revisit the decision.

Finally, people often want to share the results of their game with others to get their friends to weigh in on their decision. It's helpful to get alternate perspectives to see if they validate or differ from yours.

To that end, I'd like to make results shareable and make it easy for viewers to take your quiz so you can compare answers.

## A special thanks

I'd like to thank Marsha M. Linehan, the author of the worksheet, and Doug Benson, the person who introduced me to it.
